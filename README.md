# ML---Training-from-Scratch
A simple project to showcase Machine Learning training a FNN model from the scratch

This is a Jupyter notebook going through the math behind FeedForward Neural Network in machine learning by performing gradient descent using backpropagation for a simple neural network with a single hidden layer and an arbitrary number of nodes.
